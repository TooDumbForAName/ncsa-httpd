Changes for 1.5.1
------------------
*) Imagemaps (both internal and external) now add the path of the map file
   for non full path urls in the map file
*) A couple logging functions didn't check reqInfo->remote_name for a NULL
*) change getuid to geteuid in httpd.c so that effectively root people can
   start the server and have it change uids
*) Slight code rearrangement to make Redirects from .htaccess more 
   useful because the file doesn't have to exist. 
*) Added support for restricted access by Referer field
*) Added OnDeny command for Limit directive which allows a redirect on
   failure (esp. useful for denying by referer)
*) Added string allocating mechanism for speed
*) Added CONTENT_MD5 header support from patches by Martin Hamilton 
   (martin@net.lut.ac.uk)
*) Server doesn't keep creating more structures in the event of KeepAlive
*) Added bounds checking for security structures
*) Fixed Order mutual-failure 
*) Support both CERN and NCSA style imagemaps (on a line by line basis)
*) Attempting to make the server thread safe
*) First attempt at allowing ErrorDocument 401s as html files (still broken)
*) Fixed string searching for user in group
*) Close csd (socket) on exec of CGI scripts so that client doesn't hang
   waiting for the scripts (and their children) to finish
*) made a single interface for most output functions to make it easier
   to go to different output functions (SSL is a good example)
*) remove path_args/path_alias crap, and put it in reqInfo structure
*) Why do we require full URLs in Redirect?  A local (root) url should work fine
*) Redirect from .htaccess should work now (completely)
*) Added hack to allow SSI of CGI, at a great expense of speed (CGI_SSI_HACK)
*) Made getline() code re-entrant (now has its own sock_buf struct)
